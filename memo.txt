Memo

1. How do you communicate the different operations?
    Addition: '+'
    Subtraction: '-'
    Multiplication: '*'
    Division: '/'
    Power: '^'
    Square Root: 'sqrt()'
    
2. How do you represent numbers, how are they dilimited, and how are they separated from the operations/operators?
    Numbers are represented by the values before and after the operators ('+', '-', '*', '/', '^', 'sqrt()'). The client sends a request in this form of a string: "operator,integer1,integer2". These are separated using string parsing.

3. How do you communicate exceptional situations?
    Error messages are displayed for negative square roots and zero division.
    Negative Square Root: "Error: Negative Square Root"
    Divide by 0: "Error: Division by Zero"

4. How do you communicate shutting down a session of a client with the server?
    The user enters 'quit' to shut down a connection.
