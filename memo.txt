For the single server:
  - On the client side, the output remained in order as in the input numbers
      appeared from 1 to 1000 in increments of 1.
  - On the server side, the output appeared in order, in number order and the
      order the logging statements appeared in the code.
  - We suspect that the output occurred because the single server can only
      connect to one client connection at a time, and the rest of the
      client connections must wait for one connection to finish before
      attempting to connect to the server.


For the multithreaded server:
  - On the client side,
  - On the server side,
  - We suspect that the output occurred because

For the thread pool server:
  - On the client side, it appeared that
  - On the server side,
  - We suspect that the output occurred in a more ordered manner, but based on
      the output from the client and the server, the output appeared at random.
      For example, for the client's output the number 77 popped up when it
      looked like the numbers were well into the 100s.
