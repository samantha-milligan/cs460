Memo

1.	This protocol designates how a client may send algebraic operations,
  later defined, to a server which in turn will send the result of these
  operations.

2. The packet structure is in the form of:
          - Operator
          - Input 1
          - Input 2

3. The sections of the packet are separated by the comma, ',', character. Input
  1 and Input 2 are both character strings representing their numerical values.

4.

5. Exceptional Situations List:
      * “Client Message Not Acceptable”: If the client message is not an
          acceptable algebraic expression or a shutdown command
      * "Divide by Zero":  If the client message's algebraic operation attempts
          to divide by 0
      * "Negative Square Root": If the client message's algebraic
          operation attempts to compute the square root of a negative number

6. Exceptional Situations Process:
      * The operator section is one of the error messages from the "Exceptional
            Situations List" and input 1 is -9999.

7. To shut down a connection between the client and the server, the character
      'q' is sent in the operator section. and the server closes the connection.
